# üç™ Genetic Recipe Generator & Mini Cookbook

### 1.Overview
This project evolves cookie recipes using a Genetic Algorithm (GA) guided by an Inspiring Set Knowledgebase.
Outputs are presented by front end and rendered into a small cookbook (PDF), clearly marking AI-generated parts and including a reflection on AI use.
