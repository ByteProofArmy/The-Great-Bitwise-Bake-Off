# üç™ Genetic Recipe Generator & Mini Cookbook

### 1.Overview
This project evolves cookie recipes using a Genetic Algorithm (GA) guided by an Inspiring Set Knowledgebase.
Outputs are presented by front end and rendered into a small cookbook (PDF), clearly marking AI-generated parts and including a reflection on AI use.

### 2.Repository Structure
```
Recipebook/
  images/                # pictures used by the cookbook pages
  cookbook.pdf           # merged one-file cookbook (final deliverable)
  index.html             
  recipe_241.html        
  recipe_242.html       
  recipe_243.html       
  style.css              # shared styles (media="all" for print & screen)
knowledgeBase/           # inspiring set JSON, ingredient lists, etc.

### 3.üìö Knowledgebase (Inspiring Set)
What's in this folder?
```
knowledgeBase/
  grp11_37_cookie_knowledgebase.json
  grp11_37_cookies_recipes.json
  grp11_62_cookie_knowledgebase.json
  grp11_62_cookies_recipes.json
  grp11_combined_cookie_knowledgebase.json
  grp11_combined_cookies_knowledgebase.json
```
+ *_cookies_recipes.json: Raw recipe records scraped/cleaned from the source site(s). Includes title, ingredients (name/qty/unit), steps, and bake info.

+ *_cookie_knowledgebase.json: Enriched knowledgebase derived from the raw recipes‚Äîadds ingredient classes (e.g., fat/flour/sugar/liquid/spice), roles (binding/rising/tenderizer/seasoning/decoration), constraints (min/max/step), and tags (type/course/flavor/diet).

+ grp11_combined_*: De-duplicated merged sets (e.g., combining the 37-item and 62-item batches) to use as the default inspiring set for experiments.

> The numbers (e.g., 37, 62) indicate the batch size of collected recipes, which helps with provenance and A/B comparisons.

### 4.‚öôÔ∏è Recipe Generator (Python, Genetic Algorithm)
This module evolves cookie/cake recipes using a Genetic Algorithm (GA) guided by the inspiring set knowledgebase.
```
computational creativity recipe generator/
‚îî‚îÄ code/
   ‚îú‚îÄ data/
   ‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ inspring_set_classes.py   # ingredient classes, roles, constraints, tag vocab (typo in name is fine)
   ‚îú‚îÄ recipe_generator.py          # GA entry point (run from CLI)
‚îî‚îÄ results/                        # GA outputs (runs, logs, top-K recipes)
```

What it does?

1.Loads an enriched knowledgebase (ingredients + roles + constraints + inspiring recipes).

2.Encodes a candidate recipe as a fixed-length genome (key groups: fat/flour/sugar/binder/liquid/leavening/salt/mix-ins + bake settings).

3.Evolves a population with selection ‚Üí crossover ‚Üí mutation.

4.Scores candidates with a multi-term fitness (ratios/feasibility/style/diversity).

5.Emits the best K recipes and run artifacts into results/.

### 5.üöÄ How to Use
This guide shows the full flow:
Pick/prepare the knowledgebase; Run the genetic recipe generator; Open findout_of_results.ipynb to inspect ingredients/results; Render top recipes as HTML and export to one PDF cookbook.

#### 1) Choose the Knowledgebase
   Pick one of the enriched KB files under knowledgeBase/:
   ```
   knowledgeBase/
    grp11_37_cookie_knowledgebase.json
    grp11_62_cookie_knowledgebase.json
    grp11_combined_cookie_knowledgebase.json   # ‚Üê recommended (merged & deduped)
   ```
  > The ‚Äú*_knowledgebase.json‚Äù files contain ingredient classes/roles/constraints/tags derived from raw recipes‚Äîperfect for the GA.

#### 2) Run the Generator
From the repository root:
```
python code/recipe_generator.py \
  --inspiring knowledgeBase/grp11_combined_cookie_knowledgebase.json \
  --population 200 \
  --generations 120 \
  --elitism 0.05 \
  --cxprob 0.8 \
  --mutprob 0.2 \
  --target cookie \
  --seed 42 \
  --topk 5 \
  --out results/run_001
```

This will produce artifacts under results/run_001/, for example:

+ best.json ‚Äì best recipe phenotype (readable ingredients + bake info)

+ topk.json ‚Äì top-K recipes with fitness breakdown

+ population.csv ‚Äì optional dump of the final generation

+ run_config.json ‚Äì full config (seed/weights/operators)

+ log.txt ‚Äì generation-by-generation fitness


#### 3) Inspect Results & Recover Ingredient Lists (findout_of_results.ipynb)

Run findout_of_results.ipynb (Jupyter / VS Code).

#### 4) Render Cookbook Pages (HTML)
Pick ‚â•3 recipes and render them as HTML using your existing style:

Place pages in Recipebook/
convert it to PDF(optional)
